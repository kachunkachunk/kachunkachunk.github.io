# Uh, Hi.

I'm **Kachunkachunk**, a storage & virtualization SME, and mountain biking, film, gaming, and home labbing enthusiast. Through my struggles in any of these areas, I'll be taking the time to document some of it publicly, in the hopes that others may also benefit!

I'm not sure how much of my personal endeavors and life will end up on here, but we'll see.

# Contact

For the time being, I'll be maintaining a bit of a lower profile. But comments are enabled if you have a GitHub account, and I'll put an effort into reviewing and responding.
